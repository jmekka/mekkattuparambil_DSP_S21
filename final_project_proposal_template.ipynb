The variable pain and sensory threshhold was surveyed three times each, so that the mean of the three values would be the (pain/sensory) threshhold. Pain intensity and unpleasantness were surveyed four times (after each pain stimulation), again for the two experimental conditions. The emodiment questionnaire (seven questions) was surveyed two times, after each experimental condition (1PP, 3PP)"
